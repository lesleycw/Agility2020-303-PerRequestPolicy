Conclusion
==========

Thank you for your participation in the Access 303 - Per Request Policy Lab. 
This Lab Guide has highlighted several notable features Per Request Policies.
It does not attempt to review all F5 Per Request Policy (PRP) Features and  
configurations but serves as an introduction to allow the student to further
explore the BIG-IP platform and Access Policy Manager (APM), its functionality
& features.
